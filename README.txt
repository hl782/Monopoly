How to Play
In order to run the game, you need to install gtk (the command we used for
Linux was "sudo apt-get install gtk2.0" and the command for Mac was 
"brew install gtk+").  
You then need to install lablgtk (the command we used for both Linux and
Mac was "opam install lablgtk").  
If these were installed successfully, you can type either "make" or
"make gui" into the terminal in order to launch the game in a pop-up
window. Have fun!
