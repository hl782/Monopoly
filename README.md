# Monopoly
This is a full implementation of the classic board game Monopoly, written in OCaml. I implemented this with 3 teammates.
This was our product for the open-ended final project for Cornell's CS 3110 - Functional Programming course.

# How to Play
In order to run the game, you need to install gtk.
- The command we used for Linux was "sudo apt-get install gtk2.0".
- The command for Mac was "brew install gtk+"

You also need to install lablgtk via "opam install lablgtk".

If these were installed successfully, you can type either "make" or "make gui" into the terminal in order to launch the game in a pop-up window.

Have fun!
